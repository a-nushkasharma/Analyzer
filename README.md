# Smart Contract Vulnerability Analyzer with LLM Orchestration
An advanced, multi-phase vulnerability analysis tool for Solidity smart contracts, powered by a dual-LLM orchestration engine (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini & Google Gemini-1.5-flash) and a simple, interactive frontend built with Streamlit.

This project demonstrates a sophisticated multi-agent approach where two LLMs independently analyze a contract, cross-verify each other's findings with context from a RAG store, and reach a final consensus to produce a detailed and reliable security report

---

## Features

- Dual-LLM Analysis: Leverages the unique strengths of both OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini and Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro for comprehensive vulnerability detection.
- Multi-Phase Orchestration: A sophisticated pipeline that moves from independent analysis to cross-verification and final consensus.
- RAG-Powered Context: Uses a Retriever to provide relevant contract snippets as context during the cross-verification phase, improving accuracy.
- User-Friendly Web UI: An interactive Streamlit frontend for easy contract upload, real-time analysis progress, and clear visualization of results.
- Detailed & Structured Reports: Generates a final JSON report with confirmed/disputed vulnerabilities, including error types, confidence scores, code snippets, rationale, and recommended fixes.
